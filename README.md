## Sentiment Analysis Bale by BTN App Reviews Using IndoBERT 

### ðŸ“„ Description
<div align="justify">

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of user reviews for the **Bale by    BTN** mobile application, collected from the Google Play Store. The process began with web scraping to gather user feedback, followed by comprehensive text preprocessing including punctuation and emoji removal, stopword filtering, and normalization of colloquial Indonesian terms using a custom slang dictionary. Visual exploration was conducted using pie charts to show the distribution of sentiments and word clouds to highlight frequently occurring words across sentiment categories. For sentiment classification, the project leveraged **IndoBERT**, a pre-trained Indonesian BERT-based language model, implemented using TensorFlow and Hugging Face Transformers. The model was trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix to ensure reliable sentiment prediction.
